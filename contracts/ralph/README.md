## Layer Responsibilities

- `core/`: Defines normalized workflow semantics, invariants, CLI contracts, and terminology shared by every surface.
- `adapters/`: Maps each control surface to the `core/` contracts without changing meaning.

Core is authoritative. Adapters implement Core.

## Core vs Adapter Decision Matrix

| Change Type | Layer |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow invariant or lifecycle rule change | `core/` |
| Schema/result payload shape change | `core/` |
| Label/readiness/status semantics change | `core/` |
| Cursor slash-command wording/wiring only | `adapters/cursor/` |
| Codex skill wiring/invocation wording only | `adapters/codex/` |
| Mapping table row addition/update | `adapters/mapping.md` + impacted adapter docs |

If unsure, default to `core/` first, then adapt outward.

## Terminology

- Use `Issue` for Linear work items.
- Do not introduce non-canonical aliases when referring to Linear items.

## Change Rules

- Any contract meaning change starts in `core/`.
- Adapter updates must preserve core semantics and terminology.
- If core changes affect adapters, update impacted adapters in the same change set.
- Contract reviews must include a leakage check against `OWNERSHIP_AND_BOUNDARIES.md`.
